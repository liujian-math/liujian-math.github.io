                   1. One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, 
                          because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on. 
                          --Danica Mckellar

                   2. You do not study mathematics because it helps you build a bridge. You study mathematics because it is the poetry of the universe. Its beauty transcends mere things.
                          --Johnathan David Farley
                   </p>

                   3.  The most painful thing about mathematics is how far away you are from being able to use it after you have learned it.
--James Newman

                   4.   The art of doing mathematics consists in finding that special case which contains all the germs of generality.
--David Hilbert
                   </p>

                   5.   Mathematics is a game played according to certain rules with meaningless marks on paper. --David Hilbert
